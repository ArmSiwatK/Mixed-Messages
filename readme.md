# 1 – Plan your project

## Overview:

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Project Plan:

Just a random message generator written in JavaScript. Yes, that is half the point of the project – the other half is using GitHub here.

# 2 – Come Up with a Topic

### Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

Think about what kinds of messages you’d like your program to output. Is it a horoscope generator? A fortune teller? An inspiring phrase? Knock-knock jokes? Here’s an example of what the output of a horoscope generator could look like:

`Your sign is sun.`

`You are having good luck. `

`You should: "trust no one"`

Remember, to make your program truly random the message should really be made up of multiple strings that are output together.

Think about what parts of the string could stay the same each time and what parts could change. In the output above, what do you think are the pieces that change each time?
